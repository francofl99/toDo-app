# General info

A very simple CRUD app to manage personal tasks which I made to learn new technologies, the app allow us to create tasks, complete them and remove them

# Technologies

- Node 16.0.0
- Express 4.17.1
- Mongoose 5.11.8
- Cors 2.8.5
- Axios 0.21.1
- Vue 2.6.11
- Vuex 3.6.0
- Tailwindcss

# Setup

First at all it's necessary to have a MongoDB instance running in background, after check that, you can clone this project and install the npm dependencies:

```
$ cd toDo-app
$ npm install
```

After that, run node in the server side:

```
$ cd ./server
$ node index
```

After that, run vue in the client side:

```
$ cd ..
$ cd ./client
$ npm run serve
```

Enjoy it :)

# Inspiration

The app is based and inspired by [this CRUD app tutorial](https://albinjose.medium.com/create-a-crud-app-using-vue-js-and-node-js-mevn-stack-5410680450e4)

# Other information

The project is open to ideas ( the developer of the project as well ;) ), and you can make anything you want with it, I hope that you can learn something that you didn't know and that the project, someway, brings something new to you
